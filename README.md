## Why I Love It
1. **Nostalgic 80s References**: Music, fashion, and classic pop culture references.
2. **Thrilling Plot**: Each season brings more suspense and mystery.
3. **Complex Characters**: The characters grow in each season.

### Fun Fact
- *Stranger Things* was almost called *"Montauk"* because the story was originally set in Long Island.
